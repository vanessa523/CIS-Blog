# Microservices

My Blog on The Gartner Microservices Paper:

COSTS VS. BENEFITS OF MICROSERVICES:
    
        Considering some of the costs and benefits of microservices, reading this paper made me realize that the structure 
    of how microservices are implemented is extremely important. While the benefits of Microservices may look great, 
    it's critical to a business to consider the skills and capabilties of its developers with this architechture style, 
    along with data types and infrastructure before choosing to use microservices. Some different caspects to consider were 
    the people, especially teams of people, that would be accessing these services within the company.A well considered example 
    of a business structure using microservices is shown in figure 2 on page 7 of the paper, illustrating e-commerce use of microservices 
    to display products to a consumer. This paper was really dense in information so the included diagram really helped me 
    to visualize the recommended roles of each type of service in the background of a company. 
    
 DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES, ALTERNATIVES TO MICROSERVICES:
    
        Going into this course, I didn't know of the different types of services that could be effective in place of microservices
    depending on the intended purpose of the service. Reading about the other service options in this paper such as miniservices 
    and macroservices showed to me that there are different places within a business structure that are optimal for incorporating 
    services other than just microservices. These services still offer some of the same benefits as microservices such as improved 
    agility and system independence while being a better fit for the data and eliminating some of the risk factors. Again, referring
    back to figure 2 which was extremelt helpful demonstrates the accompanying roles of multiple services within a business.
    
   RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO MICROSERVICES:
   
            This paper taught me the importance of approaching microservice implementation gradually and with caution. In figure 5 
        on page 16 there is a mapped out plan to beginning with microservices. This plan includes starting out with enabling APIS, 
        incorporating macroservices and then moving forward to include microservices and miniservices. I thought that this was really
        valuable advice for any coporation that may be considering just jumping right into these services. 
   
   MY FINAl TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS READING:
   
        * Most organizations don't meet the extreme requirements that push for the adaptation of microservices
        * Adopting microservices requires significant investments and highly skilled developers
        * Microservices deliver better agility, but also increase complexity
        * There are several alternatives available to organizations not yet adapted to microservices
        
  FINAL THOUGHTS:
  
        From reading this paper, I think that microservices are extremely beneficial especially to large corporations
        with high requirements. However reading this definitely was informative about the many risks and factors that
        remind me not to fall for the "hype" that microservices are now recieving. Reading about alternatives and 
        responsible controlled adopting of microservices has prepared me for seeing these topics appear in a future
        workfield.
